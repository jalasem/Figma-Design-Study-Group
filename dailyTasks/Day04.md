# Getting familiar with the tools (3)

## Task List
 1. Watch [this video on smart animate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KghSZ6_9ick)
 2. Watch [this video on Mircrointeractions in Figma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHCGjxB7EYk)
 3. Study and practice [this tutorial](https://trydesignlab.com/figma-101-course/design-the-next-two-app-screens/)

## Expected Output
- Design and submit the output of your task 1 (two app screens).
  - External icons should not be used. Make your own icons. You should have been conversant with creating icons by now. With time and constant practice, you will master the art.
  - Be sure to take advantage of smart animate and microinteractions in your design to make it interactive and also feel like a real app.
  - Feel free to design more if you have more time 👨🏽‍💻⚡️🚀
